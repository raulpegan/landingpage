            <h1>About</h1>
            <h2>Brief History</h2>
            <p>I was born and raised in Caracas, Venezuela. I left the country to attend
            the undergraduate Computer Engineering program at UCSD. During my time as an
            undergrad, I co-founded a student org named Divergent Engineering (DivE). From
            my time there I met many fantastic engineering students who I worked with in
            several projects that I am very proud of, inclding 'ECE 5: Making, Breaking, and Hacking Stuff', Project in a Box (PiB), and 'ECE 140: The Art of Product Engineering'</p>
            <p>After a gap year in which I worked mainly on ECE 140, I joined the UCSD graduate program as a Master of Science student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at UCSD. I was a Computer Engineering student for a year and a quarter where I went through most of its grad curriculum, from VLSI to Parallel Computer Architecture. Instead of graduating in one more quarter, I chose to switch my focus to Machine Learning and Data Science, which caused me to stay a few more quarters. There I focused on a more theoretical/mathematical understanding of ML, in topics such as Statistical Learning and Image Processing.</p> 

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>I enjoy computer engineering. My interests lie everywhere within that 
            field: though I've always been intrested in low-level aspects such as computer 
            architecture and embedded systems, I have recently taken a liking to Web
            Development. And as my graduate education indicates, Machine Learning is my most recent dabble in a new field. Currently, I am leaning towards learning about Quantum Computing, a concept that will inevitably shift a lot of paradigms in our world. One aspect that is consistent in my passion for this field is my
            preference for all things Open Source. I like both free as in freedom and free as in
            beer, so why not. Combine those insterest with my minimalist tendencies and I 
            end up with Arch+i3 as my main workstation (I use Arch btw).</p>
            <p>One of my biggest hobbies is reading. From Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina, to Spinoza’s Ethics, to Calvin and Hobbes (the comic strip, not the philosophers. Though I shoudl check out the philosophers as well); authors hailing from every single continent (except Antartica, cuz, you know...) I enjoy reading all sorts of topics, especially those which I am not knowledgeable in. As my guilty pleasure, I love fantasy books. Tolkien might be my favorite author of all time, my
            university offers a course on Middle Earth and I took (well, audited)
            that class.... twice. My other favorite author is George RR Martin. I loved
            ASOIAF, and I can't wait for TWoW. I believe he will be remembered as the best
            fantasy author of our generation. Though Fantasy is my favorite, there are 
            other parts of genre fiction I enjoy. Dan Simmons' sci-fi epic, The Hyperion 
            Cantos, is one of my favorite stories. </p>
            <p>Find me on Goodreads to see my taste! (Under the 'About' tab).</p>
            <p>Finally, I like health and fitness quite a bit. There is such a wide 
            variety of activities within this field, so I am always busy trying something
            new.</p>
