            <h1>About</h1>
            <h2>Brief History</h2>
            <p>I was born and raised in Caracas, Venezuela. I left the country to attend
            the undergraduate Computer Engineering program at UCSD. During my time as an
            undergrad, I co-founded a student org named Divergent Engineering (DivE). From
            my time there I met many fantastic engineering students who I worked with in
            several projects that I am very proud of. 'ECE 5: Making, Breaking, and Hacking
            Stuff', Project in a Box (PiB), and The Art of Product Engineering are all
            projects whose origins can be traced back to DivE.</p>
            <p>(More info on that in the 'Projects' tab)</p>
            <p>I am currently in a gap year between my undergraduate and graduate
            education. All my efforts are channeled into The Art of Product Engineering,
            and a few minor projects.</p>
            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>I enjoy computer engineering. My interests lie everywhere within that 
            field: though I've always been intrested in low-level aspects such as computer 
            architecture and embedded systems, I have recently taken a liking to Web
            Development. One aspect that is consistent in my passion for this field is my
            preference for all things Open Source. I like free as in freedom and free as in
            beer, so why not. Combine those insterest with my minimalist tendencies and I 
            end up with Arch+i3 as my main workstation.</p>
            <p>I love fantasy books. I am currently binging through Sanderson's Cosmere 
            books, and I am very happy with it. I am chronicling my thoughts on his books
            via my Goodreads reviews. Tolkien might be my favorite author of all time, my
            university offers a course on Middle Earth and I took (well, audited)
            that class.... twice. My other favorite author is George RR MMartin. I loved
            ASOIAF, and I can't wait for TWoW. I believe he will be remembered as the best
            fantasy author of our generation. Though Fantasy is my favorite, there are 
            other parts of genre fiction I enjoy. Dan Simmons' sci-fi epic, The Hyperion 
            Cantos, is one of my favorite tales. </p>
            <p>I should give Horror a chance.</p>
            <p>Finally, I like health and fitness quite a bit. There is such a wide 
            variety of activities within this field, so I am always busy trying something
            new.</p>
