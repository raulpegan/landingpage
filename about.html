            <h1>About</h1>
            <h2>Brief History</h2>
            <p>I was born and raised in Caracas, Venezuela. I left the country to attend the undergraduate Computer Engineering program at UCSD. During my time as an undergrad, I co-founded a student org named Divergent Engineering (DivE). From my time there I met many fantastic engineering students who I worked with in several projects that I am very proud of. 'ECE 5: Making, Breaking, and Hacking Stuff', Project in a Box (PiB), and The Art of Product Engineering are all projects whose origins can traced back to DivE.</p>
            <p>(More info on that in the 'Projects' tab)</p>
            <p>I am currently in a gap year between my undergraduate and graduate education. All my efforts are channeled into The Art of Product Engineering, and a few minor projects.</p>
            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>I like POSIX, FOSS (or FLOSS when feasible), and minimalism. So here I am sitting in Arch with i3 typing away with vim. My productivity skyrocketed when I made the switch.</p>
            <p>My other main hobby is health/fitness. Thankfully, that means there are several sub-hobbies associated with that. Many different ways to be healthy nowadays, especially with all the nonsensical health fads floating around.</p>
            <p>I love fantasy books.</p>
